Fix is a simpe command line program writtern in Java to help you create "Adobe Flex" projects.
With fix you can :
  + Create projects.
  + Delete projects. 
  + Generate specific Adobe Flex, ANT build files.
  + Generate flex-config.xml files.
  + Generate Adobe AIR descriptor files.
  
I created Fix because I wanted to shared my Adobe AIR/AS3/Flex projects 
around and I'm not always using FlashBuilder.
